            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub is not a new company it has been around for close to a decade (it was founded in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner), despite its recent popularity in the tech industry. GitHub is a web based repository and web hosting service company. What makes GitHub so special is that is has roughly 20 million users and 57 million repositories which makes it the largest host of source code in the world. That is a huge feat. GitHub was designed to mainly use and share code which is why it has received some criticism for being aimed specifically towards programmers. Ironically, it was intended for that purpose; collaboration on projects related to tech.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Benefits of Using GitHub</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The benefits of using GitHub are having a secure place to back up your files locally and remotely in case of any accident where your files on your computer or usb are deleted or lost. Also, specifically in the remote repository one of the best benefits is that it will not override your files when you send multiple files of the same name. GitHub will save each of them as separate copies even though they have the same name which prevents overriding a file you really needed. This feature is called VSC, or version control systems and is very important, it basically allows files to be restored at different times when they were saved. It is also, an open-source community which allows other users to share and use files. It is a great collaboration tool which allows projects to get done faster because you can push and pull files that other project members can see and then pull, make some changes, then push again. The other benefits are having potential future employers able to see your work and it's a great space to showcase your talents and best work achievements.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GitHub Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GitHub has a number of useful commands that are proprietary and are needed to conduct any work on the web based repository. For example, the command "git add [file name]" allows the user to add a file to the staging area. If you want to add multiple files, then you would just add an a to the end of the command "git add -A". Then, you will have to commit the files that you want to send over to the repository which is "git commit -m". From, there you can just pull files from the repository using the "git pull" command then push it back to the repository using the "git push" command. It is a simle process that reminds me of the ocean waves; a back and forth process of push and pull.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">GitHub Commands Cnt'd</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Aside from the basic commands that I learned about interacting with GitHub, there are a few other commands that seem rather important. Such as, in GitHub you can review all of the changes that were made to a document by using the "git log". And if you are a perfectionist, like me, then you might be interested in the really detailed log using the command "git log --summary". These two command will make it much easier to find problems or to just track changes made and make sure a project is moving slowly.  Aside from that, GitHub allows the user to create new branches to their repositories and merge and checkout branches.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">VCS</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems are one of the main components of GitHub that make it relatively useful. Version control is a system that records changes in a files or multiple files and allows you (the user) to recall a previous version of that file. According, to the GitHub not only can you revert back to points of a file or project, but you can also, see who last modified a file, review the changes you have made to that file over time and a few more nifty tricks. Especially, in the realm of programmers and coders, where implementing a solution the first time may not provide the adequate results which means you'll need to revert back to the previous point. And it helps to have the original file, instead of having to rely on memory.</p>
